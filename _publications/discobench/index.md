description: "**TL;DR:** DiscoBench is an open-ended framework for evaluating automated algorithm discovery, e.g. via AI research agent systems. DiscoBench has a modular setup, an emphasis on discovering algorithms that transfer, and a huge diversity of tasks! We hope DiscoBench helps drive the frontier of research in algorithm discovery by providing a large-scale, open-ended landscape for evaluating AI research agents!"
